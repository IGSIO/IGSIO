\class WindowsAccurateTimer
\brief Accurate delay and stopwatch function implementation in Windows

  This timer class was designed to give high precision < 2% average
  error and it was designed to work best with multi-threaded clients
  waiting on the single instance of this timer.

  Note that there are timer API that are simpler to implement or use, but they are far more inaccurate.
  For example, for a 1ms time delay the measured error (http://omeg.pl/blog/2011/11/on-winapi-timers-and-their-resolution/)
    timeSetEvent             : count= 999, avg error= 1.268%, std dev= 1.695
    Busy wait                : count= 999, avg error= 0.225%, std dev= 3.743
    CreateTimerQueueTimer    : count= 999, avg error= 4.185%, std dev=11.480
    SetTimer                 : count=  62, avg error=1450.387%, std dev=415.344
  timeSetEvent API has the smallest variability and negligible mean error.

  The implementation is based on this code sample:
  From http://www.codeguru.com/Cpp/W-P/system/timers/comments.php/c5759/?thread=63096

  The code works best in multithreaded environment when the number of threads need to wait on the same shared timer object.
  Note that to calculate precise timing it uses high resolution counters. As it has been pointed out in the previous comments,
  that even though this code will work happily on most of the machines, depending on the chip manufacture it may sometimes fail,
  thus one may want to reserve to using only decrement counter as in the original timer example, relying on the fact that timer
  callback gets called every 1msec by the multimedia timers.
  Extra half msec was added purely from my experimental results - to provide higher precision level, you may wish to take it out
  if you are not happy or dont understand why it is there.
  Setting process and thread priority is needed here because NT schedule doesnt deal quite right with the processes that run in
  the background when threads get suspended and resumed. It gives very high precision results when run in the foreground but
  causes delays when run in trhe background unless priority is adjusted. Priority does not cause any problems unless your
  process monopolises all available CPU - timer code by itself consumes pretty much 0%.
